#A Hybrid Rocket Engine Simulation: A Bachelor's Thesis

The following contains a bachelor's thesis with the main intent of explaining why the often seen pressure spikes in the rocket's starting phase occur. This is done via simulations in Matlab, combined with thermodynamical solutions being carried out in Engineering Equation Solver (EES).

Notes for the bachelor project can be found as comments within the individual .tex files, and scattered around where necessary. The project meant to be understandable by anyone with my prefacing physics background, which is three years at Aarhus University.
