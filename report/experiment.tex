\chapter{Rocket Tests}

	MEOWTH II was tested at Peter Madsen's space laboratory in Copenhagen, on the 3rd to the 4th of May 2016 by Team Rocket of Navitas. The whole ordeal has spawned several articles, which the interested reader can find in appendix \ref{App:A}. A  complete logbook along with a firing procedure can be found in appendix \ref{App:B}.

	The test setup can be seen in figure \ref{fig:rocketpic}, and the first burn can be seen on the front page. The test stand consists of a metal fixture that holds the rocket in a vertical position, with the hydrogen--peroxide tank upright. The metal fixture keeps the rocket from moving under tests. Sandbags are placed on top in order to stop fast--moving shrapnel, in case of a complete engine destruction. Further safety instructions can also be found in appendix \ref{App:B}.

	The purpose of the experiments was to measure the variations in pressure throughout the rocket. The following will be an analysis of the data collected, along with a brief description of the sensors involved. A group consisting of three students also took video footage of the tests in order to analyze the rocket's shock diamonds, this will not be treated here, however.

	\section{Equipment}

	Eight pressure sensors were mounted on the rocket, ranging over three measurement frequencies: $\SI{250}{\Hz}$, $\SI{2000}{\Hz}$ and $\SI{10000}{\Hz}$. \fxnote{20khz??} One of each sensor was placed in both the rocket's mixing chamber and decomposition chamber. The two remaining sensors, a slow and a fast, were mounted by the hydrogen--peroxide tank. The measurement equipment was connected to a DAta Acquisition (DAQ) system from National Instruments, which in turn was connected to the data--logging software LabVIEW on a nearby slave unit. The slave unit was remotely controlled by a computer inside the safety--submarine, which allowed ignition and data--logging nearby the test site without being in danger.

	Two manometers were placed before and after the pressurization valve, in order to manually check the tank's pressure before ignition.

	A more thorough discussion of project improvements can be found in chapter \ref{cha:perspective}.

	\section{Experimental Procedure}

	\end{figure}

	MEOWTH II was built specifically with the intent of being fast to rearm. The large flanges allows quick unbolting, and the hydrogen--peroxide tank has a quick-fill valve. The only swappable objects which changes the combustion rate is the decomposition nozzle and the fuel--grain. The tank's pressurization changed throughout the experiments, which greatly influences the flow--rate of hydrogen--peroxide. An analysis of the tank's pressure's influence on flow--rate has not been executed, however, that could be a subject for a future project. The wagon--wheel fuel grain design (see figure \ref{fig:wagonwheel}) was kept throughout the experiments, which makes the decomposition nozzle the only variable in the experiments.

	Apart from changing larger parts of the experimental setup, reloading proceduce requires swapping the rocket's interior. In figure \ref{fig:kmno4foam2}, the decomposition chamber is visible with its inner MDF--shell casing, filled with \chem{KMnO_4}--permeated foam. The inner casing prevents liquid puddles from not building up and causing trouble, in the form of instant vapourization into large quantities of gas.

	\begin{figure}
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{wagonwheelburnt}
		\caption{Wagon-wheel shaped grain as seen in figure \ref{fig:wagonwheel} after a test. Notice the wagon-wheel pattern has been burnt through, and instead a "flower"--pattern is present. Experimentally this can be seen as a small drop in pressure as seen in the results.}
		\label{fig:burntgrain}
	\end{figure}

	Swapping the wagon-wheel grain with an identical copy after every test is essential to receive consistent results, as it is worn greatly during combustion. As seen in figure \ref{fig:burntgrain}, the grain's inner walls are burnt through about two--thirds through every test. This greatly influences the grain's regression--rate, making new-- and old--grain experiments vastly different.

	Preliminary tests were done with water, as to check the newly made decomposition nozzle. Testing with water also showed leaks, making it easier to tighten and seal before loading the toxic high--concentration hydrogen--peroxide. After preliminary tests, four tests were concluded and will be discussed below.

	\section{Results}



% Testing of the rocket engine ensued at "Raketmadsens Rumlaboratorium" in Copenhagen on the 3rd to the 4th of may 2016. The tests were carried out by me in company by my advisor Gorm Bruun Andresen, and seven other students from Navitas.

% A total of ten measurements were collected at every test. The most essential is the Piezoelectric pressure sensors located at the front. The simulation calculates the pressure after the combustion chamber, and at the nozzle's exit.

%
% The experimental and simulation results are seen in figure \ref{fig:peakBurn2wsim}, where the blue line is the experimental results, and the red is the simulated pressure. The simulation assumes no combustion until a temperature of $\SI{220}{\celsius}$, at which all of the oxygen inside the combustion chamber is instantly consumed, followed by a steady burning phase. The instantaneous combustion looks like an explosion, as more oxygen is available at this point than at any other. The experimental front pressure dips shortly after initial combustion, which may be due to a shockwave moving through the rocket, forcing new oxygen from flowing to the grain's surface for a short period of time. The pressure then drops rapidly to a steady state, where the simulation ends just prior. The abrupt ending is due to a bug in the current version of the simulation software EES, which crashes after a certain number of iterations. Future versions may allow the calculation of the steady state. Take note of the simulation's timescale, as the duration of the peak is very small, almost only two tenths of a second.
