\chapter{Rocket tests}

Testing of the rocket engine ensued at "Raketmadsens Rumlaboratorium" in Copenhagen on the 3rd to the 4th of may 2016. The tests were carried out by me in company by my advisor Gorm Bruun Andresen, and seven other students from Navitas.

Day 1:

Rocket setup, establishing connection to remote pc, being locked out, installing labview

Day 2:

Worthy mentions: Tighten flanges correctly, make sure O-rings are in place.


\section{Firing Procedure}
Launching the rocket requires several crucial steps in order to safely ignite the engine. Safety is the number one priority, thus, a stepwise checklist is necessary.
