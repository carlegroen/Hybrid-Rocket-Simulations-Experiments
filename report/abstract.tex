\chapter*{Abstract}

A hard start is a dangerous phenomenon which most hybrid rockets experience during startup. Chamber pressure spikes to almost twice of what is expected, yet not much is known about the event. 
This work presents a model to describe hybrid rocket engine's burst in pressure during ignition. A modeled delayed ignition, in accordance to the fuel grain's autoignition temperature, allows accumulated pyrolyzed fuel and oxygen to instantly combust in an explosive manner. Good agreement between experimental pressure measurements and simulation is observed. The hypothesis that high autoignition temperatures yield larger pressure variations is proposed, which can be tested by changing the fuel grain's autoignition temperature in future experiments.
