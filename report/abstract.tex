\chapter*{Abstract}

I present a model to describe hybrid rocket engine's burst in pressure during ignition. I have modeled a delayed ignition in accordance to the fuel grain's autoignition temperature, which allows accumulated pyrolyzed fuel and oxygen to instantly combust in an explosive manner. Good agreement between experimental pressure measurements and simulation is observed. The hypothesis that high autoignition temperatures yield larger pressure variations is proposed, which can be tested by changing the fuel grain's autoignition temperature in future experiments.
