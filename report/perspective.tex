\chapter{The Project's Future}

After intitial combustion, the resulting shockwave may move faster than the flame velocity, thus quickly extinguishing the flame before resuming a steady state. This may be an explanation for the small dip in observed pressure around the initial spike seen in the test. Thus, this is someone worthwhile calculating if moving on further with the project. The solution is probably contained in the book \emph{The Principles of Fire Behaviour}, as found in the bibliography \cite{principlesoffire}.
